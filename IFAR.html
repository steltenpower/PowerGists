<b>Use the power of open …</b><br>
In case you think your data is not fit for different uses, remember “The best use of your data is often created by someone else”. A colleague or fellow earthling will surprise you, if only with a more insightful datavisualisation.
Having your sheets open might save you from typos before presenting them.
Popular open source software has a community bringing quality and being a welcome force against expensive vendor lock-in.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>… and flavours of partly open</b><br>
It's a great idea to have a general data inventory, but probably with limitations for parts:<br>
  - leaving out some datasets for those not having special clearance<br>
  - showing not the data itself, but only the structure, along with <button>synthesize data!</button>
  </td></tr><tr><td>
<b>More DOING directly together instead of only communicating ABOUT it, especially pairing.</b><br>
<img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming/benefits_overview.jpg" width="400" align="left" valign="top">
All those important things deemed too little for regular meetings like “what button did you touch there?”, or “Actually I didn’t understand, can you explain?” or “how are the kids?” or 
“if only it could have been magically documented while doing”, especially since we’ll never go back to the office every day and are social creatures still. And as a bonus you’ll get an intelligently filtered context-specific implicit messaging service: “Oh, in that case, I have a handy trick for you that Trudy showed me the other day …”<br>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Less “copy-paste waste“</b><br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steltenpower/PowerGists/main/DeadPapers.png" height="200" align="left" valign="top">
Much of our ‘digital work’ is actually mostly simulating paper.
  <a href="https://wiki.surfnet.nl/pages/viewpageattachments.action?pageId=59803702&preview=/59803702/65242021/ELN%20-%20V2-1080p-220420%20edit2.mp4">“Rock, Paper, E-science notebooks” (3:12)</a> explains how that’s error-prone and very unlikely to be reproducible.<br>
Reproducibility needs more than 'only' literature references you manage with e.g. Zotero  
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Everybody edit</b><br>
Learn from the success of Wikipedia and Github. Do your access restrictions mainly limit the introduction of errors (easily rolled back with proper version control), 
or limit quick improvements and updates from your community and beyond? Demand that access too when working with external parties.
And when you really (really?) can't have others edit the production version, use this method sometimes named Pull Request:
  Anybody can <button>EDIT</button> and <button>Send in Suggested edits</button>
  so the person responsible for code or content can <button>Highlight DIFFerences side by side</button> and <button>Accept Suggestions</button>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Write on the open web!</b><br>
Whatever you seem to be repeating over and over, people could have found earlier on your blog, Wikipedia, etc.
And as we tend to forget things; your future self will thank you too.<br>

  Oh, and instead of pages of Powerpoint, why not try browsertabs of content to go through? Also avoids some licensing hassle.

<b>Give inbox zero, worship agendas</b><br>
<a href="https://gripboek.nl/preorder"><img src="https://gripbook.com/img/grip-book-cover-uk.png" height="200" align="left"></a>
Other people like inbox zero too, so send them less. Agenda, Tasks, Messages is your order of priority. If people keep sending you “SAVE THE DATE” messages without an invite, or 5 reminders for an event you already declined or registered for, maybe start replying “SPAM-BLOCKED: repetitive”?<br>
Team schedules in other places are fine, but usually much better when tightly coupled with personal agenda’s.
And when “life happens” with an emergency or killer headache it’s hard to remember who to call this time, inform about things to cancel/postpone,
  let alone register days. Automate it via a meeting named ‘sick’? Matching your tasks with your energy levels and moods is an important part of working with your agenda too.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>“Do disturb” scheduling</b><br>
Next to “do not disturb” have “please DO disturb” blocks in your agenda for communication of things that work better through immediate interaction where planning a meeting feels as “too much”.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>NO double manual entry</b><br>
For example: You keep your agenda really well and as a reward you can manually enter all again in project and overall time registration systems?
  And in the mean time there’s no warning that everybody of a 24/7 team is saving up free days till the end of the year?
  This can be done smarter, and not by some imaginary 'silver bullet' 'total solution' application, but by standardizing on data formats and APIs, and allowing choice in software.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Less context-switching saves even more capacity</b><br>
Trimming time spent on non-primary things also trims time context-switching; getting into something, concentrated, again, costs capacity big time. Times how many people?

<b>Everybody responsible for data quality and rewarding</b><br>
Where many years ago it became unacceptable to not be able to type, now the minimum IT-skillset includes making your data friendly for further processing.
Learn some basic rules with <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/">Data organization in Spreadsheets</a> from carpentries.org, 
  a website that offers many more "foundational coding and data science skills" for those interested.<br>
If you think you can completely leave all of that ‘to the IT folks’ also, you’re setting things up for the ump-teenth over-expensive IT-project that should be named a disaster.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Explain value, demand value</b><br>
If you want certain data, explain why, make it quick and easy, and reward by quickly giving value created from it. If you don’t give value, you’re probably overestimating the actual value you get.
Also, ask what apps people love to use outside of work and why? A combined payment&expense app perhaps?.

  An example: For findability, consistency and readability reasons scholarly communication uses 'citation styles'. It's bad enough that there are thousands of those styles,
  but especially now science is more and more disciplinary, it's annoying the reader can't choose, but the author decides in a permanent way.
  To allow future improvements on this situation it is advised to unambiguously write down the style used.

<b>Think beyond staring at Microsoft Teams at home or office.</b><br>
Next to lightboards, telepresence robots, VR, acting in front of a 2-way video wall,
  and zooming in on hands instead of face there’s also just going for a long walk through old forests together. Less tech can be smarter.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Apply datavisualisation inspiration everywhere</b><br>
For example: Most search user interfaces still look a lot like the original ’10 blue text links’.
  <a href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/">Open Knowledge Maps</a> (also in use by the Dutch National library) does things differently and helps you figure out the right search keywords at the same time.

  For example: Nowadays you can tell your device, by voice, what you want in an image and get a reasonable one in seconds.
  Possibly saving you hours of more manual image creation.
  Or prototype a new shape of interaction, putting human interaction and hands-free first, starting with buying a broom stick. ☺

<b>The FAIR (data quality) principles</b> are here to help you (classify and reap the benefits, quickly) for your (research) data.

  a library card catalog, where the cards are digital and called “Metadata Record” containing properties and relations, both written in Linked Data vocabularies.
  Both the object described and its Metadata Record have their own URL, often a type of Persistent IDentifier (PID).<br>
<br>
It can well be that some of the metadata is already available in the described file itself, but with several possible notations and possibly huge files,
  doubling a little metadata is efficient.
Of course an API is built-in to let search engines harvest.
For the administration systems in PID minting agencies I imagine those ‘library cards’ to be be partially pre-filled already depending their type (DOI, ORCID, ROR, PIDINST, etc.)

<b>A(ccessible)</b>: is a bit broader than how to be able to download files from a certain server: Files can be distributed for reasons of capacity (e.g. BitTorrent)
  or control (e.g. SoLiD PODs).
  And for data that is either giant (CERN) or highly sensitive (Personal Health Train) the analysis script is moved towards the data,
  and only the results are returned (after a possible manual check). And even having no access to actual data (yet) can be helpful,
  cause with the structure available, dummy or synthesized data can be generated to already start working with.

To make meaning explicit, it shouldn’t be something you start thinking about only after having acquired or created an application.
Applications implicitly put meaning to values, data standards makes it explicit.
  Also a way to heavily save on constructing app2app connections (possibly number of apps squared, n²), e.g. in Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).
Whenever someone utters “application landscape” ask them to read the <a href="https://datacentricmanifesto.org">DataCentricManifesto</a> (again) to prevent trouble.

<b>Be consistent</b><br>
Similar to how spelling checkers use a list of valid words for quality control, that also helps search engines index better, there’s something similar for tabular data:
  <a href="https://frictionlessdata.io/">Frictionless data</a> helps you, among other things,
  to define what values are valid for each column in so-called schema’s and check data against them.
  Part of that is fixing for the many differences introduced by many different versions, localizations and preferences of Excel and others,
  e.g.: Ever seen □ or � where you expected different characters,
  or asked your colleague with a diacritic in their name how often systems seem unable to work with them properly?
  IT is many layers of agreements, with usually multiple options for each, but so-called validators can help find your mistakes in most of them.

  A clearly readable unambiguous practically implementable specification can be quite the undertaking, depending the scope.

<b>Linked Data</b><br>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steltenpower/PowerGists/main/LinkedData.png" height="300" align="left">
aka semantic web aka RDF/SPARQL aka knowledge graph, it's especially fit to implement a significant part of what the FAIR principles demand, especially with more research being multi-disciplinary nowadays.
Often the primary research data files are not of one of the linked data formats, but the metadata or descriptions are.
With the Linked Data Wizard it’s easy to batch convert from tabular data like CSV.
  Relational SQL databases can also have a live translation layer, RML, so it can be SPARQL-queried like a triplestore (linked data database). And don't forget you can also have selections in documents/graphics/applications as data to refer to or from and processed by search engines (see RDFa and schema.org).
You can create your own vocabulary for the relations if you wish,
  but for the most matches you first want to look into vocabularies already in use, e.g. <a href="https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/">Linked Open Vocabularies</a>.
  If you think your data quality is not up to it yet, I'll add "Not in production, but as it increases the chance of detecting those problems …".

As prevention is better than cure, and even so called loss-less conversions introduce change by definition, you don’t want to find out at the moment of publication or archival that something’s wrong with your files.
What if things like Windows File Explorer or the file menu of any (web)application could give you useful warnings and suggestions?

Providing good metadata is not a researchers primary concern to make quite the understatement.
  But what if you make it really easy&quick and valuable as early as possible?
  What if during brainstorming about what to research next you rapidly draw a mindmap that is surrounded by related auto-suggestions?
  A digital multi-dimensional variant of not just picking the book you want from the shelf,
  but also taking a peek at what more is on that shelf, for serendipity reasons.
  Using linked data because on one side it's ideal to connect data from different contexts fragmented over application silos
  and on the other side our brains work associatively too.
Also, there’s a rich ecosystem of Linked Open data sources with billions of statements already available,
  the LOD cloud (OpenAlex for example connects wikidata concepts with ORCIDs and DOIs for scholarly metrics and more.
  SURF’s edusources.nl uses it to relate open educational resources to domain-specific vocabulaires).
Could this help humanity? If we keep an eye on energy use, possibly.
  Let’s find out! Get in contact.

Praise colleagues, supporters, everybody, and then explain what you think could be even significantly easier, faster, more valuable, maybe how, design, prototype, or even implement. Invest time and money to take a step back and see the higher summit behind the closer one.
