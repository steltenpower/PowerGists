<b>LESS DETOUR ? ATTENTION, NOT FRAGMENTATION !</b><br>
<table border=1><tr><td>
<b>More DOING directly together instead of only communicating ABOUT it, especially pairing.</b><br>
All those important things deemed too little for regular meetings like “what button did you touch there?”, or “Actually, I didn’t really understand it, can you explain?” or “how are the kids?” or 
“if only it could have been magically documented while doing”, especially since we’ll never go back to the office every day and are social creatures still. And as a bonus you’ll get an intelligently filtered context-specific implicit messaging service: “Oh, in that case, I have a handy trick for you that Trudy showed me the other day …”<br>

<b>Less “copy-paste waste“</b><br>

<b>“Do disturb” scheduling</b><br>
Next to “do not disturb” have “please DO disturb” blocks in your agenda for communication of things that work better through immediate interaction where planning a meeting feels as “too much”.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Everybody=IT</b><br>
Where many years ago it became unacceptable to not be able to type, now the bottom IT-skillset in-cludes making your data friendly for further processing. Learn some basic rules with “Data organization in Spreadsheets” from carpentries.org <i>https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/</i><br>
If you think you can completely leave all of that to ‘the IT folks’ too, you’re setting things up for the ump-teenth over-expensive IT-project, or disaster.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Give inbox zero, worship agendas</b><br>
Other people like inbox zero too, so send them less. Agenda, Tasks, Messages is your order of priority. If people keep sending you “SAVE THE DATE” messages without an invite, or 5 reminders for an event you already declined or registered for, maybe start replying “SPAM-BLOCKED: repetitive”?<br>
<img src="https://gripbook.com/img/grip-book-cover-uk.png" height="200"><br>
Team schedules in other places are fine, but usually much better when tightly coupled with personal agenda’s.
And when “life happens” with an emergency or killer headache it’s hard to remember who to call, inform about things to cancel/postpone, let alone register days. Automate it via an invite to ‘sickbay’?
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>No double entry</b><br>
For example: You keep your agenda really well and as a reward you can manually enter all again in project and overall time registration systems? And in the mean time there’s no warning that everybody of a 24/7 team is saving up free days till the end of the year. Automatic estimates and suggestions to accept or deny would help.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Less context-switching saves even more capacity</b><br>
Trimming time spent on non-primary things also trims time context-switching; getting into something, concentrated, again, costs capacity big time. Times how many people?
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Explain value, ask for value</b><br>
If you want certain data, explain why, make it quick and easy, and reward by quickly giving value creat-ed from it. If you don’t give value, you’re probably overestimating the actual value you get.
Also, ask what apps people love to use outside of work and why? A combined payment&expense app perhaps?.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Use the power of open</b><br>
In case you think your data is not fit for different uses, remember “The best use of your data is often created by someone else”. A colleague or fellow earthling will surprise you, if only with a more insightful datavisualisation.
Having your sheets open might save you from typos before presenting them.
Popular open source software has a community bringing quality and limiting your expensive vendor lock-in.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Think beyond staring at Microsoft Teams at home or office.</b><br>
Next to lightboards, telepresence robots, VR, acting in front of a 2-way video wall, and zooming in on hands instead of face there’s also just going for a long walk together. Less tech can be smarter.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Apply datavisualisation inspiration everywhere</b><br>
For example: why does every search system have ’10 blue text links’ as results? OpenKnowledge Maps (also in use by the Dutch National library) does things differently and helps you figure out the right search keywords at the same time.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Try something new, or crazy</b><br>
For example: Nowadays you can tell your device, by voice, what you want in an image and get a rea-sonable one in seconds. Possibly saving you hours of more manual image creation. Or prototype a new shape of interaction, putting human interaction and hands-free first, starting with buying a broom stick.<br>

<b>MORE DATA CONNECTED ? FA.R</b><br>
<table border=1><tr><td>
<b>The FAIR (data quality) principles</b> are here to help you (classify and reap the benefits, quickly) for your (research) data.
There’s a giant and growing body of interesting expert theoretical FAIR work and practical experience (for example Virus Outbreak Data Network, VODAN) but here I focus on only some awareness, misunderstandings and suggestions.

<b>FAIR Oversimplified</b><br>

Or <i>“tying together (research) data worldwide for as far as allowed and reasonably possible”.</i><br>
In which everything as machine-actionable as possible, to not only make current type of research easier, but also allowing <b> new scale of multi-disciplinary research</b> through machine-assistants.<br>

The mentioned <b>metadata</b> is a description, where that anything can also be data. 
A great example: DCC-PO link (Max’s soup can)
A little container from the store without a label: would you eat out of it? Has the best-before-date passed? Do you have allergies? Is it really yoghurt?<br>

A FAIR Data Point (FDP) is like a library card catalog, where the cards are digital and called “Metadata Record” containing properties and relations, both written in Linked Data vocabularies. Both the object described and its Metadata Record have their own URL, often a type of Persistent IDentifier (PID).<br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Schlagwortkatalog.jpg/1418px-Schlagwortkatalog.jpg" width="200"><br>
It can well be that some of the metadata is already available in the described file itself, but with several possible notations and possibly huge files, doubling a little metadata is efficient.
Of course an API is built-in to let search engines harvest.
For administrations in PID minting agencies I imagine those ‘library cards’ to be be partially pre-filled already depending their type (DOI, ORCID, ROR, PIDINST, etc.)
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>A(ccessible)</b>: is a bit broader than how to be able to download files from a certain server: Files can be distributed for reasons of capacity (BitTorrent) or control (SoLiD PODs). And for data that is either giant (CERN) or highly sensitive (Personal Health Train) the analysis script is moved towards the data, and only the results are returned (after a possible manual check). And even having no access to actual data (yet) can be helpful, cause with the structure dummy or synthesized data can be generated to already start working with.

<b>Meaning/semantics/ambiguity</b><br>
If you process information you must know and tell what it means, what it’s about. How often do people seem to understand what the others mean, to find out in the next meeting weeks later, it’s slightly or completely different, if not forgotten at all? And diversity, though usually improving potential, can make misunderstanding a little more likely. To help that, below we’ll focus on the FAIR character we saved for last, the one that goes beyond machine-readable into allowing machine-actionable.

<b>Start Data-centric</b><br>
To make meaning explicit, it shouldn’t be something you start thinking about after having acquired an application.
Applications implicitly put meaning to values, data standards makes it explicit. Also a way to heavily save on constructing app2app connections (possibly number of apps squared, n²), e.g. in Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
Whenever someone utters “application landscape” ask them to read the DataCentricManifesto (again) to prevent trouble.

</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Be consistent</b><br>
Similar to how spelling checkers use a list of valid words for quality control, that also helps search engines index better, there’s something similar for tabular data:
•	Frictionless data helps you, among other things, to define what values are valid for each column in so-called schema’s and check data against them. Part of that is fixing for the many differences introduced by many different versions, localizations and preferences of Excel and others, e.g.: Ever seen □ or � where you expected different characters, or asked your colleague with a diacritic in their name how often systems seem unable to work with them properly? IT is many layers of agreements, with usually multiple options for each. https://frictionlessdata.io/

<b>Be specific</b><br>
What does “1/2” mean? Jan 2nd, Feb 1st, or 0.5 or 0,5?
Is “string” about musical instruments or underwear?
Is salmon an animal or a food?
And of course things may seem obvious to just you and all you need just now, but you better from the start …
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Use, specify, combine and co-create standards</b><br>
-	Maybe you cite in APA, but which version or localization? Write that down! Is there a machine-readable way? By the way, shouldn’t the reader be able to pick the style? https://github.com/steltenpower/CitationStyleOnReading
-	Use ISO8601 to write dates like YYYY-MM-DD that have the extra advantage of chronological being alphabetical. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
-	In some notations you can mix standards, where sometimes an extra identifier “namespace” is used to keep them apart
-	If there are no standards yet for what you try to describe, you can make your own definitions. A clearly readable unambiguous practically implementable specification can be quite the undertak-ing, depending the scope. Doing it together with other experts from the domain might turn into something as ubiquitous as HTML for first linked documents and nowadays also apps. For data there’s also a (web)technology building on URLs for addressing and typing the links, where the types are defined in domain-specific vocabulaires. The technology is named Linked Data. Also indexed by the big search engines.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<b>Linked Data</b><br>
Linked data (aka semantic web aka RDF/SPARQL aka knowledge graph) is especially fit to implement a significant part of what the FAIR principles demand. https://twitter.com/steltenpower/status/1593716702667227137
Linked Data: technology to ask structured questions to databases, spreadsheets and documents [see blue/green] connected together through relations of domain-specific standardized terminology between their subelements" e.g.: >Persons interested in things created by Da Vinci? BOB!
Often the primary research data files are not of one of the linked data formats, but the metadata or descriptions are.
With the Linked Data Wizard it’s easy to batch convert from tabular data like CSV. Relational SQL databases can also have a live translation layer, RML, so it can be SPARQL-queried like a triplestore (linked data database).

Also, there’s a rich ecosystem of Linked Open data sources with billions of statements already available, the LOD cloud (OpenAlex for example connects wikidata concepts with ORCIDs and DOIs for scholarly metrics and more.
