**WHAT ARE WE THINKING ? ARE WE?**

**Are we paying attention? Listening?**

**Do we think the same language?**

**Can we improve our communication (of thoughts)?**

**Some inspiration …**

https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/wp-content/uploads/dac-import/mind-meld.jpg

**„Philosophische Untersuchungen“ (Philosophical Investigations),** **Wittgenstein**

Stated language only works as part of the context-specific interplay.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language\_game\_(philosophy)

**“The humane representation of thought”, Bret Victor**

Says something like: (tiny rectangles & tiny movements) ==> (tiny thoughts & tiny actions).

And shows directions to instead be full humans working with information and powerful tools. 13:45-14:50 & 16:05-16:25 of https://vimeo.com/115154289

**“Thinking beyond the brain”, Annie Murphy Paul**

Mentions how too often the model of a knowledge worker is a brain stuck too close to a computer screen https://media.sciencephoto.com/image/c0544094/800wm/C0544094-Computer\_screen\_with\_a\_brain,\_illustration.jpg RED CROSS https://stock.adobe.com/nl/search?k=green+tick+and+red+cross&asset\_id=435243439

and how that is highly ineffective as it ignores powerful capabilities that evolved over human history, to think with our body, surroundings and community. https://anniemurphypaul.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3dbookcover02-200x300.png GREEN CHECKMARK           

**"Ons werk is stuk" (our work is broken), Martijn Aslander**

explains

\= how we’re still mostly stuck in the dogma of the document

\= how organisational hierarchies need a fundamental update into the current web era of highly educated people

\= how far the effects of serious neglect of usability reach; we postpone/procrastinate, won’t use the tool, rush it, the resulting data is off and so are the decisions based on it.

\= how we need to stop the fragmentation of data over a wide and always changing application landscape.

\= how the GDPR (or “AVG” in Dutch) brings a lot of good (though it needs serious improvements), but also scared many into limiting more than demanded. https://pixiecreations.nl/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cover-boek.jpeg

  

**LESS DETOUR ? ATTENTION, NOT FRAGMENTATION !**

**More DOING directly together instead of only communicating ABOUT it, especially pairing.**

All those important things deemed too little for regular meetings like “what button did you touch there?”, or “Actually, I didn’t really understand it, can you explain?” or “how are the kids?” or “if only it could have been magically documented while doing”, especially since we’ll never go back to the office every day and are social creatures still. And as a bonus you’ll get an intelligently filtered context-specific implicit messaging service: “Oh, in that case, I have a handy trick for you that Trudy showed me the other day …” https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming/benefits\_overview.jpg

**Less “copy-paste waste“**

Much of our ‘digital work’ is actually mostly simulating paper. “Rock, Paper, E-science notebooks” explains how that’s error-prone and very unlikely to be reproducible. screenshot of 0:34 https://wiki.surfnet.nl/pages/viewpageattachments.action?pageId=59803702&preview=/59803702/65242021/ELN%20-%20V2-1080p-220420%20edit2.mp4

**Everybody edit**

Learn from the success of Wikipedia and Github. Do your access restrictions mainly limit the introduction of errors (easily rolled back with proper version control), or limit quick improvements and updates from your community or beyond? Demand that access too when working with external parties.

Pull Request? Anybody can \[EDIT button\] and \[Send in Suggestion\] so person responsible for content can \[Highlight DIFFerences side by side\] and \[Accept Suggestion\]

**Write on the open web!**

Whatever you seem to be repeating over and over, people could have found earlier on your blog, Wikipedia, etc.

And as we tend to forget things; your future self will thank you too.

Oh, and instead of pages of Powerpoint, why not try browsertabs of content to go through? Also avoids some licensing hassle. https://github.com/steltenpower/tabs-as-sheets

**“Do disturb” scheduling**

Next to “do not disturb” have “please DO disturb” blocks in your agenda for communication of things that work better through immediate interaction where planning a meeting feels as “too much”.

**Everybody=IT**

Where many years ago it became unacceptable to not be able to type, now the bottom IT-skillset includes making your data friendly for further processing. Learn some basic rules with “Data organization in Spreadsheets” from carpentries.org https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/

If you think you can completely leave all of that to ‘the IT folks’ too, you’re setting things up for the umpteenth over-expensive IT-project, or disaster.

**Give inbox zero, worship agendas**

Other people like inbox zero too, so send them less. Agenda, Tasks, Messages is your order of priority. If people keep sending you “SAVE THE DATE” messages without an invite, or 5 reminders for an event you already declined or registered for, maybe start replying “SPAM-BLOCKED: repetitive”? https://gripbook.com/img/grip-book-cover-uk.png

Team schedules in other places are fine, but usually much better when tightly coupled with personal agenda’s.

And when “life happens” with an emergency or killer headache it’s hard to remember who to call, inform about things to cancel/postpone, let alone register days. Automate it via an invite to ‘sickbay’?

**No double entry**

For example: You keep your agenda really well and as a reward you can manually enter all again in project and overall time registration systems? And in the mean time there’s no warning that everybody of a 24/7 team is saving up free days till the end of the year. Automatic estimates and suggestions to accept or deny would help.

**Less context-switching saves even more capacity**

Trimming time spent on non-primary things also trims time context-switching; getting into something, concentrated, again, costs capacity big time. Times how many people?

**Explain value, ask for value**

If you want certain data, explain why, make it quick and easy, and reward by quickly giving value created from it. If you don’t give value, you’re probably overestimating the actual value you get.

Also, ask what apps people love to use outside of work and why? A combined payment&expense app perhaps?.

**Use the power of open**

In case you think your data is not fit for different uses, remember “The best use of your data is often created by someone else”. A colleague or fellow earthling will surprise you, if only with a more insightful datavisualisation.

Having your sheets open might save you from typos before presenting them.

Popular open source software has a community bringing quality and limiting your expensive vendor lock-in.

**Think beyond staring at Microsoft Teams at home or office.**

Next to lightboards, telepresence robots, VR, acting in front of a 2-way video wall, and zooming in on hands instead of face there’s also just going for a long walk together. Less tech can be smarter.

**Apply datavisualisation inspiration everywhere**

For example: why does every search system have ’10 blue text links’ as results? OpenKnowledge Maps (also in use by the Dutch National library) does things differently and helps you figure out the right search keywords at the same time.

**Try something new, or crazy**

For example: Nowadays you can tell your device, by voice, what you want in an image and get a reasonable one in seconds. Possibly saving you hours of more manual image creation. Or prototype a new shape of interaction, putting human interaction and hands-free first, starting with buying a broom stick.

**MORE DATA CONNECTED ? FA.R**

**The FAIR (data quality) principles** are here to help you (classify and reap the benefits, quickly) for your (research) data.

There’s a giant and growing body of interesting expert theoretical FAIR work and practical experience (for example Virus Outbreak Data Network, VODAN) but here I focus on only some awareness, misunderstandings and suggestions.

**FAIR Oversimplified** https://srs.saxion.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SRS\_poster\_2019\_FAIR-724x1024.jpg

Or “tying together (research) data worldwide for as far as allowed and reasonably possible”.

  

In which everything as machine-actionable as possible, to not only make current type of research easier, but also allowing **A new scale of multi-disciplinary research** through machine-assistants.

The mentioned **Metadata** is a description, where that anything can also be data.

A great example: DCC-PO link (Max’s soup can)

A little container from the store without a label: would you eat out of it? Has the best-before-date passed? Do you have allergies? Is it really yoghurt? 3:30-3:37 https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3w1pog

  

First some remarks about FA.R.

**F(indable):**

https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article/doi/10.1162/dint\_a\_00160/112599/fair-data-point-a-fair-oriented-approach-for

A FAIR Data Point (FDP) is like a library card catalog, where the cards are digital and called “Metadata Record” containing properties and relations, both written in Linked Data vocabularies. Both the object described and its Metadata Record have their own URL, often a type of Persistent IDentifier (PID). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Schlagwortkatalog.jpg

It can well be that some of the metadata is already available in the described file itself, but with several possible notations and possibly huge files, doubling a little metadata is efficient.

Of course an API is built-in to let search engines harvest.

For administrations in PID minting agencies I imagine those ‘library cards’ to be be partially pre-filled already depending their type (DOI, ORCID, ROR, PIDINST, etc.)

 **A(ccessible):** is a bit broader than how to be able to download files from a certain server: Files can be distributed for reasons of capacity (BitTorrent) or control (SoLiD PODs). And for data that is either giant (CERN) or highly sensitive (Personal Health Train) the analysis script is moved towards the data, and only the results are returned (after a possible manual check). And even having no access to actual data (yet) can be helpful, cause with the structure dummy or synthesized data can be generated to already start working with.

  

Sidenote: Not “accessibility”, aka “a11y”,

https://assets-global.website-files.com/583347ca8f6c7ee058111b55/5c119a2e1c06a0b428d6b052\_keuhQlsNfQYW-besjf8oWesFJiHVYPJDggHZsTu766B3Q8JnKwt5-73q617zdDXhtG8Scrf0TpI0QS\_GIN9PhACLd9e5nBxhP690yUWjdi9Al4Mqt8MDPU2tWEfdNGVOK8zxyIvI.png

 **R(e-usable)** is about being allowed by law. Closed as necessary, open as possible.

An open license boosts re-use according to both traditional citation count and altmetrics.

Indirectly, but also related to security classifications and tools that make working with them easier:

https://help.libreoffice.org/6.1/he/text/swriter/classificationbar.html

Would a license-aware copy-paste functionality help this R?

**MORE FITTING ? INTEROPerability!**

I, **Interop**erability (“best for last” of FAIR, though certainly not the last to attend to for success)

**Meaning/semantics/ambiguity**

If you process information you must know and tell what it means, what it’s about. How often do people seem to understand what the others mean, to find out in the next meeting weeks later, it’s slightly or completely different, if not forgotten at all? And diversity, though usually improving potential, can make misunderstanding a little more likely. To help that, below we’ll focus on the FAIR character we saved for last, the one that goes beyond machine-readable into allowing machine-actionable.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) learns, our limitations**

Though very powerful, AI is still ‘just calculation’ applied to ‘pattern recognition’, not magic: https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1\*bt-E2YcPafjiPbZFDMMmNQ.jpeg

And it needs training data, somewhere based on A LOT of manual classification https://blog.apify.com/content/images/2021/08/bike-captcha---Copy-1.jpg

That together with the ambiguity of natural language can easily go wrong https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/yijd3c/they\_asked\_an\_ai\_engine\_to\_recreate\_a\_salmon/

**Being exact is hard, even for simple daily tasks**

0:09-0:14 & 0:25-0:32 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct-lOOUqmyY

**We at least can improve and must**

To prevent things like again crashing an expensive mars lander by ASSUMING the wrong units (metric (cm, etc.) versus imperial (inch, etc.)), or get people killed daily by ElectronicPatientDossiers (EPD) not being interoperable. https://www.simscale.com/blog/nasa-mars-climate-orbiter-metric and https://www.npostart.nl/2doc/15-09-2022/KN\_1727593

**Start Data-centric**

To make meaning explicit, it shouldn’t be something you start thinking about after having acquired an application.

# Applications implicitly put meaning to values, data standards makes it explicit. Also a way to heavily save on constructing app2app connections (possibly number of apps squared, n²), e.g. in Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)

# Whenever someone utters “application landscape” ask them to read the DataCentricManifesto (again) to prevent trouble.

https://datacentricmanifesto.org Image of the remark about Enterprise information being a mess.

**Be consistent**

Similar to how spelling checkers use a list of valid words for quality control, that also helps search engines index better, there’s something similar for tabular data:

·       Frictionless data helps you, among other things, to define what values are valid for each column in so-called schema’s and check data against them. Part of that is fixing for the many differences introduced by many different versions, localizations and preferences of Excel and others, e.g.: Ever seen □ or � where you expected different characters, or asked your colleague with a diacritic in their name how often systems seem unable to work with them properly? IT is many layers of agreements, with usually multiple options for each. https://frictionlessdata.io/

**Be specific**

What does “1/2” mean? Jan 2nd, Feb 1st, or 0.5 or 0,5?

Is “string” about musical instruments or underwear?

Is salmon an animal or a food?

And of course things may seem obvious to just you and all you need just now, but you better from the start …

**Use, specify, combine and co-create standards**

\-       Maybe you cite in APA, but which version or localization? Write that down! Is there a machine-readable way? By the way, shouldn’t the reader be able to pick the style? https://github.com/steltenpower/CitationStyleOnReading

\-       Use ISO8601 to write dates like YYYY-MM-DD that have the extra advantage of chronological being alphabetical. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601

\-       In some notations you can mix standards, where sometimes an extra identifier “namespace” is used to keep them apart

\-       If there are no standards yet for what you try to describe, you can make your own definitions. A clearly readable unambiguous practically implementable specification can be quite the undertaking, depending the scope. Doing it together with other experts from the domain might turn into something as ubiquitous as HTML for first linked documents and nowadays also apps. For data there’s also a (web)technology building on URLs for addressing and typing the links, where the types are defined in domain-specific vocabulaires. The technology is named Linked Data. Also indexed by the big search engines.

**Linked Data**

Linked data (aka semantic web aka RDF/SPARQL aka knowledge graph) is especially fit to implement a significant part of what the FAIR principles demand. https://twitter.com/steltenpower/status/1593716702667227137

Linked Data: technology to ask structured questions to databases, spreadsheets and documents \[see blue/green\] connected together through relations of domain-specific standardized terminology between their subelements" e.g.: >Persons interested in things created by Da Vinci? BOB!

Often the primary research data files are not of one of the linked data formats, but the metadata or descriptions are.

With the Linked Data Wizard it’s easy to batch convert from tabular data like CSV. Relational SQL databases can also have a live translation layer, RML, so it can be SPARQL-queried like a triplestore (linked data database).

Visualiseer queryen van RDF wolk: Fair Data Points, Persistent Identifiers, open LODcloud, closed internal RDF from relational databases (with RDF-ivy layer), spreadsheets that you clicked through LDwizard, and RDFa that puts some semantic structuring in (web)documents.

  

**MAKING IT EASIER ? USABILITY !**

**existing: FAIR browser add-on?**

https://github.com/MaastrichtU-Library/the-FAIR-extension

**prototyped: FAIRfilesListing / FAIRwarning / FAIRsuggestion**

**As prevention is better than cure**, and even so called loss-less conversions introduce change by definition, you don’t want to find out at the moment of publication or archival that something’s wrong with your files.

What if things like Windows File Explorer or the file menu of any (web)application could give you useful warnings and suggestions? https://github.com/steltenpower/FAIRfilesListing

**designed: TrainOfThought aka IdeationGraph**

Providing good metadata is not a researchers primary concern to make quite the understatement. But what if you make it really easy&quick and valuable as early as possible? What if during brainstorming about what to research next you rapidly draw a mindmap that is surrounded by related auto-suggestions? A digital multi-dimensional variant of not just picking the book you want from the shelf, but also taking a peek at what more is on that shelf, for serendipity reasons. Using linked data because on one side its ideal to connect data from different contexts fragmented over application silos and on the other side our brains work associatively too.

Also, there’s a rich ecosystem of Linked Open data sources with billions of statements already available, the LOD cloud (OpenAlex for example connects wikidata concepts with ORCIDs and DOIs for scholarly metrics and more. SURF’s edusources.nl uses it to relate open educational resources to domain-specific vocabulaires).

Could this help humanity? If we keep an eye on energy use, possibly. Let’s find out! SHOW a short video to fake it, including this URL https://github.com/steltenpower/TrainOfThought

**Keep improving**

Praise colleagues, supporters, everybody, and then explain what you think could be easier, faster, more valuable, maybe how, design, prototype, or even implement. Invest time and money to take a step back and see the higher summit behind the closer one.

**END ?**

**So …. , not futile, right?**

**Do your thing!**

**Together!**

both sides of my phone standard I once gave to the (then&now) boss of my university: Connecting Data & Cooperating People:

  

**Trying to be a catalyst for insight, to have others make more impact, by improving their information skills and tools. Systems thinker showing links. Available for corrections and details.**
