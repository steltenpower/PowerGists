(or elevator pitches about cooperation, towards potential users/deciders easily scared off by tech-jargon)

Organisational first steps towards (data/content) quality and speed:
====================================================================
- Tiny errors make big errors (elsewhere, later, seemingly unrelated often even unnoticed). Therefore preventing+finding errors should be close, early and relations made visible.
- Fresh high-quality data should be rewarded by minimizing (other) disturbances. Wonder for a moment what analysis comes from 'just another thing to fill in for management'.
- People working/living in immediate context of the data usually know best what values/patterns make sense. Help them configure immediate validation, sharing and loosely coupled visualization and also analysis elsewhere/later will improve.
- Start by turning on spelling checkers, especially because our digital assistents (starting with search) are easily 'confused'.
- Let everybody learn a few basic rules to [avoid Excel pitfalls](https://github.com/steltenpower/avoid-Excel-pitfalls) towards 'tidy data'.

Fully unlock your (DATA) potential:
===================================
- data-centric (manifesto): Not apps, but YOU decide what you mean, where to store it, in what format and how and where access regime is defined.
- Linked Data: associative as brains and communities. Links databases and documents, internal and external, open and closed, and late integration systems.
- FAIR data: Findable-Accessible-INTEROPERABLE-Reusable; enabling earlier, wider, AI-assisted cooperation
- Knowledge Graphs: organizations organized, learning from (content from) each other while doing

Electronic Lab Notebooks:
=========================
Shared on-line documents in which writers and 'programming analysts' can cooperate. Reproducibility through:
- No, or less install (differences). Possible within security context of data.
- Less manual copy-paste between different applications. 
- Tighter feedback loop between people with different focus (tech-savvy or not, researchers and supporters, reviewers and communicators)
- Backend can run on High Performance Computing (HPC) too.
- [Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJDxcR1V7Qg) is probably the most popular and has many derivatives. Others are Rnotebook(Rstudio) and ObservableHQ.

Git(hub):
=========
De facto standard for managing changes in file sets:
- Simultaneously working on the same file with multiple apps/users is no problem.
- Related files can be kept consistent within 1 change.
- Asks to comment changes for readable history to navigate.
- Many (related) workflow/project tools

Open data:
==========
- Open license
- No logins, cookies, or custom apps needed
- Open specifications and open vocabularies to validate against
- Next to legally open, also easy to do stuff with

FAIR (data) principles:
======================
- Domain-specific tagging and archiving make something FINDABLE: keyword can give web address
- Persistent identifiers and (machine-readable) conditions for visitors make something ACCESSIBLE: web address can give file
- Common open file formats and vocabulaires make something INTEROPERABLE: file can give compatible data
- Allowing different things with different licenses makes something REUSABLE: using input data in output data

Accessibility:
==============
- Giving people freedom to pick their methods of interaction.
- Devices are different, people and their preferences are different, circumstances are different and all interact and keep changing.
- Laws demand certain levels of accessibility, also to minimize limitations brought by handicaps.
- Accessibility for people also gives (some) accessibility for their (digital) assistants

SVG:
====
- visuals that can be static/generated/interactive objects
- searchable text in any shape, filters, styling, animating, infinite sharp zoom
- part of the (modular) web and (specifically) composable HTML; anything in the browser and loads of apps too.
- abbreviation of Scalable Vector Graphics
