# PowerGists
(My personal cheatsheets for elevator pitch/dialogue to only spark interest for ways of tech-supported cooperation. Tech jargon and implementation details are for later.)

Organisational first steps towards (data/content) quality and speed:
====================================================================
- Tiny errors make big errors (elsewhere, later, seemingly unrelated often even unnoticed). Therefore preventing+finding errors should be close, early and relations made visible.
- Fresh high-quality data should be rewarded by minimizing (other) disturbances. Wonder for a moment what analysis comes from 'just another thing to fill in for management'.
- People working/living in immediate context of the data usually know best what values/patterns make sense. Help them configure immediate validation, sharing and loosely coupled visualization and also analysis elsewhere will improve immediately.
- Start by turning on spelling checkers, especially because our digital assistents (starting with search) are easily 'confused'. The more data is combined, the more sensitive it is to data imperfections.
- Let everybody learn a few basic rules to [avoid Excel pitfalls](https://github.com/steltenpower/avoid-Excel-pitfalls), towards 'tidy data'.
- Pairing, instead of some of the alternation between group discussion and lone work: More immediate-feedback hands-on working with 2. Both at 1 flex desk making good use of richness of In-Real-Life communication with gestures, objects, etc., and remote with audio connection and simultaneously working in the same application context. As this is a different social construct, it allows for more personalized communication and concrete learning, passed on to sessions with others where applicable.

Fully unlock your (data) cooperation potential:
===============================================
- [data-centric (manifesto)](http://datacentricmanifesto.org/): Not apps, but YOU decide what you mean, where to store it, in what format and how and where is defined what roles/groups/people have what access.
- [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data): associative as brains and communities. Links databases and documents, internal and external, open and closed, including late integration systems like ESBs. Enables querying any combination of sources, as if one virtual dataset.
- [FAIR data](#fair-data-principles): Findable-Accessible-INTEROPERABLE-Reusable; enabling earlier, wider, AI-assisted cooperation. Everybody in research data management is working on this. Training by [carpentries.org](carpentries.org) and others gets researchers on board.
- [Knowledge Graphs](https://open.hpi.de/courses/knowledgegraphs2020): organizations organized, learning from (content from) each other while doing. Gartner (paywalled):["Top Trends in Data and Analytics for 2021: Graph Relates Everything"](https://www.gartner.com/document/3996989)
- If you have done a lot of the above, you better allow for Artificial Intelligence (AI) too 

Electronic Notebooks:
=====================
Shared on-line documents in which writers and 'programming analysts' can cooperate. Reproducibility through:
- No, or less install (differences). Possible within security context of data.
- Less manual copy-paste between different applications. 
- Tighter feedback loop between people with different focus (tech-savvy or not, researchers and supporters, codecheckers/reviewers and communicators)
- Backend can run on High Performance Computing (HPC) too.
- [Jupyter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJDxcR1V7Qg) is probably the most popular and has many derivatives. Others are Rnotebook(Rstudio) and ObservableHQ.
- For different contexts it is possible to view a conversion to a different format: static Word/PDF, stand-alone interactive HTML, fully-fledged but non-editable.

Git(hub):
=========
De facto standard for managing changes in file sets:
- Simultaneously working on the same file with multiple apps/users is no problem.
- Related files can be kept consistent within 1 change.
- Asks to comment changes for readable history to navigate.
- Many (related) workflow/project tools

Open data:
==========
- Open licenses, e.g. [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/)
- No logins, cookies, or custom apps needed
- Open specifications and open vocabularies to validate against
- Next to legally open, also easy to process

[FAIR (data) principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/):
======================
- Domain-specific tagging and archiving make something FINDABLE: keyword can give web address
- Persistent identifiers and (machine-readable) conditions for visitors make something ACCESSIBLE: web address can give file
- Common open file formats and vocabulaires make something INTEROPERABLE: file can give compatible data
- Allowing different things with different licenses makes something REUSABLE: using input data in output data
- For maximum effect the above should be as EARLY as possible, within the primary workflow. For example: [A suggestion for FAIR filesViewing](https://github.com/steltenpower/FAIRfilesViewing)

Accessibility:
==============
- Giving people freedom to pick their methods of interaction.
- Devices are different, people and their preferences are different, circumstances are different and all interact and keep changing.
- Laws demand certain levels of accessibility, also to minimize limitations brought by handicaps.
- Accessibility for people (also a11y), gives (some) accessibility for their (digital) assistants too

SVG:
====
- static/generated/interactive VISUALS consisting of objects that are intrinsically structured/layered/relatable
- searchable text in any shape, filters, styling, animating, infinite sharp zoom
- part of the (modular) web and (specifically) composable HTML; anything in the browser and loads of apps too.
- abbreviation of Scalable Vector Graphics
