# PowerGists

Idea: Very short and simple video clips to show/explain the WHY of things relating to (research) data
For the title shot: zoom in on (Wikipedia) page.

Electronic Lab Notebook:
========================
It's cooperation and support in the same context

Git(hub):
=========
Version control for sets of files: compare different versions, concurrent changes are not overwriting each other. Every change to (a part of) the set is given a little explanation for what changed, together telling the story of development.
Github is a website that runs Git, and much more (which is good and bad). You should probably have your code somewhere else too

CSV:
====
Uncoupling how to work with data. Entry in context. With tech help, constraint can be applied, immediate feedback charts added. With better data, better analysis. Possibly much later, and somewhere else. Also less waiting for a specific date to pass, to bring out a report. That's paper-era thinking. Data can be very useful earlier too.

data quality:
=============
Just a few examples. If you spell "bik", someone probably won't find the text by search term "bike". Spelling is important, use spell checkers.
