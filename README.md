Idea: Very short and simple video clips to show/explain the WHY of things relating to (research) data
For the title shot: zoom in on (Wikipedia) page for the title, a draft if necessary.


Electronic Lab Notebook:
========================
Reproducibility through:
- No, or less install (differences). Possible within security context of data.
- Less manual copy-paste between different applications. 
- Tighter feedback loop between people with different focus (tech-savvy or not, researchers and supporters, reviewers and communicators)
- Backend can run on High Performance Computing too.

Git(hub):
=========
De facto standard for managing changes in file sets:
- Simultaneously working on the same file with multiple users is no problem.
- Related files can be kept consistent within one change.
- Asks to comment changes for a readable history to navigate.
- Loads of (related) workflow/project tooling


unlock your (data) potential:
=============================
- data-centric (manifesto): Not apps, but YOU decide what you mean.
- FAIR data: Findable-Accessible-INTEROPERABLE-Reusable; enabling earlier, wider, AI-assisted cooperation
- linked data: associative as brains and communities
- knowledge graphs: organizations organized, learning from each other while doing


Uncoupling how to work with data. Entry in context. With tech help, constraint can be applied, immediate feedback charts added. With better data, better analysis. Possibly much later, and somewhere else. Also less waiting for a specific date to pass, to bring out a report. That's paper-era thinking. Data can be very useful earlier too.
data quality:
Just a few examples. If you spell "bik", someone probably won't find the text by search term "bike". Spelling is important, use spell checkers.
