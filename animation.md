# ROCK, PAPER, ~~SCISSORS~~ SCIENCE NOTEBOOKS

How the very first rock hard science documents were made ...<br>![tablets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/technology-backup-backed_up-spare-history-caves-shr1435_low.jpg)

... and delivered to readers.<br>![trebucheting](https://www.toonpool.com/user/3107/files/send_email_380405.jpg)

Luckily lighter materials were soon found ...<br>![paper airplane](https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/31-317183_painted-paper-plane-hand-png-download-free-clipart.png)

... easily stained however.<br>![birdshit](https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/147-1472116_royalty-free-collection-of-high-quality-free-cliparts.png)

Shit makes inventful though ...<br>![feather pen](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQF8SI83PV8vXV1DoUtGe4-wt_IT3Bq7BGJ6RVZlUnh64Azp9eGOwRd7vzZUaIzrqte6Ik&usqp=CAU)

... with contraptions for lousy scriblers ...<br>![typewriter](https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/23/67/drawing-of-old-typewriter-with-a-paper-in-black-vector-20272367.jpg)

... later shielding against bird droppings ...<br>![monitor](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/old-retro-crt-monitor-display-blank-white-screen-isolated-background-162226372.jpg)

... and hiding most of the typewriter.<br>![keyboard](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FOT/CW6G/HPFZZGBK/FOTCW6GHPFZZGBK.jpg?auto=webp)

Then digitalization brought limitless possibilities ...<br>![cloud](https://images.theconversation.com/files/243663/original/file-20181102-83644-b06itk.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop)

... but physical paper (simulation) habits stayed ...<br>![cutPaste](https://diy.bostik.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_crop/public/2020-10/Bostik-DIY-SouthAfrica-Stationery-Cut%27nPaste-40g%2Bscissors-product-teaser-600x600.jpg?itok=fLdeEB0t)

... not using the hyper-connected interactivity of the web<br>![dead papers](deadpapers.jfif)

Part is content type incompatibilities:<br>![CopyPasteWaste](CopyPasteWaste.png)

- styled text becoming plain text<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- Formulas becoming raster images, in which you can't search<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- infinite zoomable vector graphics turned into a pixelated raster images<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- video becoming a silent snapshot<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- interactive objects becoming dead photos<br>[animatedIMG needed?]<br><br>


Probably more important, but not as easy to notice: the context and process is lost, a **disaster for REPRODUCIBILITY**:
- Reasoning about and experimenting with the matter, is frustrated<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- It's awfully difficult to keep files consistent with each other (within specified versions). Google "git" when finished reading this page<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- A later change in the source will not be automatically reflected in where it's copied to. There it will be out of date<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- A slightly wrong selection to copy (a decimal point missed?) is often impossible to detect in the result, let alone repairable<br>[animatedIMG needed?]


# EMBED YOUR DATA SCIENCE IN A WEB-POWERED NOTEBOOK INSTEAD!
We all know hyperlinks to manually click from one page to the next, but web addresses (or URLs) can do much more. Algorithms (these things computer programmers create) use URLs to refer to up-to-date input data. And now there's a way to edit, run and show the output of algorithms within your **TEXT** in so-called Electronic Lab Notebooks. So where shared documents like Google Docs and Word within Teams are famous for cooperating among writers, these notebooks allow to add programmers, **CODE** (in which anybody can read where data comes from) and results (often **PLOT**).
![Text, Code, Result](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789800265/graphics/assets/318443e2-2a55-4b0e-b59a-b89118d0b7ff.png)
## *Especially NON-techies :heart: this, because without being forced to code themselves, they have short feedback cycles with their techy colleagues (or support staff) and after a while often start some coding themselves too.*
And as notebooks are usually built on web technology, you can then include almost anything found on the web.

**JUST TRY IT WITH YOUR TEAM**: For **open science** reasons, my order of preference is:

_psst: Notebooks can be exported to several formats, both dynamic (dashboards, web apps, etc.) and static (e.g. stone tablets now named PDF)._

- If you like this, you probably like [FAIR files listing](https://github.com/steltenpower/FAIRfilesListing) too. Have a coder available for a bit, to implement further?
- A bit more difficult to wrap your head around, but the more powerful: [Train of Thought](https://github.com/steltenpower/Train-Of-Thought/blob/main/README.md). Slowly moving forward, possibly a lot faster soon.
