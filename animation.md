# PAPER HISTORY

How it all started ...<br>![tablets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/technology-backup-backed_up-spare-history-caves-shr1435_low.jpg)

Be where the readers are, one thought<br>![trebucheting](https://www.toonpool.com/user/3107/files/send_email_380405.jpg)

Luckily lighter materials were found<br>![paper airplane](https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/31-317183_painted-paper-plane-hand-png-download-free-clipart.png)

Easily stained however<br>![birdshit](https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/147-1472116_royalty-free-collection-of-high-quality-free-cliparts.png)

But shit makes inventful<br>![feather pen](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQF8SI83PV8vXV1DoUtGe4-wt_IT3Bq7BGJ6RVZlUnh64Azp9eGOwRd7vzZUaIzrqte6Ik&usqp=CAU)

For lousy scriblers a mechanical contraption was developed<br>![typewriter](https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/23/67/drawing-of-old-typewriter-with-a-paper-in-black-vector-20272367.jpg)

Against sneezing and bird droppings many people covered their paper document with a glass plate and put a lamp behind it<br>![monitor](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/old-retro-crt-monitor-display-blank-white-screen-isolated-background-162226372.jpg)

Electronics moved most of the typewriter behind the paper, leaving only a thin keyboard in front of it, attached by some wire<br>![keyboard](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FOT/CW6G/HPFZZGBK/FOTCW6GHPFZZGBK.jpg?auto=webp)

Nowadays invisible wires connect to some cloud that allows typing on papers elsewhere<br>![cloud](https://images.theconversation.com/files/243663/original/file-20181102-83644-b06itk.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop)

# PAPER STILL

What 4-letter word, that our narratives nowadays are often heavily based on, was not mentioned so far ????

hints: ????-driven, or better: ????-assisted

DATA !!!!

But, aren't many documents still much like a sheet of paper in some sort of typewriter?

# NO COPY-PASTE WASTE !

- Some manual copy-paste errors are not just unlikely, but impossible to find, thus fix. Similar to typos.
- The interative thought process resulting in content is not part of the pasting: no version control on the output and where applicable no protocol or source code, let alone properly versioned. That's disastrous for REPRODUCIBILITY and for trying, discussing, learning and improving.
- There's no (later) synchronization between input and output content of a copy-paste action

_[Word icon surrounded by icons for Matlab, SPSS, Excel, atlas.ti, Qualtrics, etc. and arrows towards Word and a big red cross through all]_

# EMBED INSTEAD !

With so-called **Electronic Lab Notebooks** you can enrich your writing with
- anything from the web. Dynamic things too.
- RUNNING CODE blocks. Especially NON-techies :heart: this, because without being forced to code themselves, they can have their techy colleagues (or support staff) in the same shared document doing their magic.

_[Show the writing, the web content and the RUNNING CODE blocks]_

# JOIN TOO !
For **open science**, my order of preference: _[icons for Jupyter, Rstudio Rnotebooks, Observable Notebooks]_

_psst: Notebooks can be exported to several formats, both dynamic (dashboards, websites, etc.) and static (stone tablets now named PDF)._
