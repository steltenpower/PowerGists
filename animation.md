# ROCK, PAPER, ~~SCISSORS~~ SCIENCE NOTEBOOKS

How the very first rock hard science documents were made ...<br>![tablets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/technology-backup-backed_up-spare-history-caves-shr1435_low.jpg)

... and delivered to readers.<br>![trebucheting](https://www.toonpool.com/user/3107/files/send_email_380405.jpg)

Luckily lighter materials were soon found ...<br>![paper airplane](https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/31-317183_painted-paper-plane-hand-png-download-free-clipart.png)

... easily stained however.<br>![birdshit](https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/147-1472116_royalty-free-collection-of-high-quality-free-cliparts.png)

Content-type not interoperable``*``:
- Losing style<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png)
- Losing direct edit, search, index.<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png)
- Losing sharpness<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png)
- Losing interactivity, movement and sound<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png)

<br><br><br><br>

Losing context and process; **KILLING REPRODUCIBILITY**:
<br>>>> Put them in a 2x2 grid!!!
- When you didn't copy (or type) what you thought you did, it is often impossible to detect, let alone repair<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png)
- No experimenting``**``.<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png)

# EMBED YOUR DATA SCIENCE IN A WEB-POWERED NOTEBOOK INSTEAD!
We all know hyperlinks to manually click from one page to the next, but web addresses (or URLs) can do much more. Algorithms created by computer programmers for example use URLs to refer to up-to-date input data. And now there's a way to edit and run these algorithms (aka **Code**), plus show their output (often **Plot**) within your **Text** in so-called Electronic Lab Notebooks. So where shared documents like Google Docs and Word/Teams are famous for cooperating among writers, these notebooks allow to add programmers.
![Text, Code, Result](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789800265/graphics/assets/318443e2-2a55-4b0e-b59a-b89118d0b7ff.png)
## *Especially NON-techies :heart: this, because without being forced to code themselves, they have short feedback cycles with their techy colleagues (or support staff) and after a while often start some coding themselves too.*
As these notebooks are built on web technology, you can include/embed almost anything found on the web. The helpful communities around them have also created all sorts of things to extend them, so many of your "wouldn't it be nice if ..."-wishes are already implemented and available.

**JUST TRY IT WITH YOUR TEAM**: For **open science** reasons, my order of preference is:
![notebook brands](notebooks.png)

_psst: Notebooks can be exported to several formats, both dynamic (dashboards, web apps, etc.) and static (e.g. stone tablets now named PDF)._

``*``: To easier take more advantage of open file formats [FAIR files listing](https://github.com/steltenpower/FAIRfilesListing) was thought up. Looking to have it implemented everywhere for you, so help out!

``**``: make sure to look into the de facto standard for version control: [git](https://thenewstack.io/tutorial-git-for-absolutely-everyone/)

A 1080p YouTube clip is under development with the above as introduction, followed by some actual (not too technically overwhelming) notebook-based cooperation. Suggestions are very welcome. Help out!
