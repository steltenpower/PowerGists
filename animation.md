_fuzz and fade out everything but the title and then slam a question on 4 times: "WHAT?", "WHY?", "WHERE?", "HOW?"_

A LITTLE BIT OF PAPER HISTORY, _scrolling horizontally through time_:
- "how it all started ..." ; _cavemen chiseling tablets_ , somewhat similar to ![tablets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/technology-backup-backed_up-spare-history-caves-shr1435_low.jpg)
- "be where the readers are, one thought" ; _trebucheting_ , somewhat similar to ![trebucheting](https://www.toonpool.com/user/3107/files/send_email_380405.jpg)
- "Luckily lighter materials were found" ; _after CHISELING something paperthin, it is folded into an airplane and thrown, landing on someone's desk_ , somewhat similar to ![paper airplane](https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/31-317183_painted-paper-plane-hand-png-download-free-clipart.png)
- "Easily stained however" ;  _hit by bird droppings_ ![birdshit](https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/147-1472116_royalty-free-collection-of-high-quality-free-cliparts.png)
- "Which made some people angry and inventful"![feather pen](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQF8SI83PV8vXV1DoUtGe4-wt_IT3Bq7BGJ6RVZlUnh64Azp9eGOwRd7vzZUaIzrqte6Ik&usqp=CAU)
- For lousy scriblers some mechanical contraption was developed ![typewriter](https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/23/67/drawing-of-old-typewriter-with-a-paper-in-black-vector-20272367.jpg)
- Against sneezing and bird droppings many people covered their paper document with a glass plate and put a big lamp behind it.![monitor](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/old-retro-crt-monitor-display-blank-white-screen-isolated-background-162226372.jpg)
- When electronics became available most of the typewriter moved behind the paper between the glass plate and the lamp, leaving only a thin keyboard in front of the paper, attached by some wire ![keyboard](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FOT/CW6G/HPFZZGBK/FOTCW6GHPFZZGBK.jpg?auto=webp)
- "Nowadays there are also invisible wires, that through some cloud (nobody has ever identified), can attach to a paper document somewhere else" ![cloud](https://images.theconversation.com/files/243663/original/file-20181102-83644-b06itk.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop)

That intro of fantasy and strange reality, might have confused you enough to open your mind. Some questions:
- "What, that our narratives nowadays are often heavily based on, was not mentioned at all? ...."
- "Aren't many documents much like a sheet of paper behind a glass plate? How not?"
- _.... becomes "DATA"_
---
- "How do you get non-text into documents? Do you see risks for non-reproducibility? Can these be limited?"
- "COPY-PASTING?" _show document surrounded by some popular applications like SPPS, Excel, MATLAB, Firefox, etc._
- OFTEN WASTING:
- Just as with typos, manual copy-paste errors might never get found, let alone fixed ; __
- That what gets pasted in, doesn't show what happened before, how a thought process iterated it. And the paster might not have logged it either.
- The version pasted in doesn't just come with a unambiguous recipe (interpretable by people or algorithms) for reproducibility.
- After it's pasted, it can't be experimented with. No trying, discussing, learning, improving.
- If what is copied is updated later, the copy will be out-of-date.

"EMBED INSTEAD":
- 'general web embeds'; _show photo, video, interactive whiteboard, iframe, any web content from elsewhere_
- "and notebook specific RUNNING CODE cells" ; _animation of external programs turning into internal editable cells_
- "And of course your familiar text paragraphs"
---
"Most importantly: Many non-techies love it because without being forced to code themselves, they have their techy colleagues in the same shared document doing their magic."

Give it a try?
---
CONVERT OR NOT?:
- "you can convert notebooks into many common formats" _docx PDF dashboards view-only-notebooks etc_

- "or invite people into them with just a link" _for training, testing, reviewing, publishing or getting in-context support" ; _show logos for carpentries, codecheck, etc_
- "Try Jupyter, Rnotebook, observableHQ, others, and take a peek at what extensions are available" ; _show logos for Jupyter, Rnotebook, ObservableHQ, nbconvert, fast_ai?_
