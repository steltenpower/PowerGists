# PAPER HISTORY

How it all started ...<br>![tablets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/technology-backup-backed_up-spare-history-caves-shr1435_low.jpg)

Be where the readers are, one thought<br>![trebucheting](https://www.toonpool.com/user/3107/files/send_email_380405.jpg)

Luckily lighter materials were found<br>![paper airplane](https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/31-317183_painted-paper-plane-hand-png-download-free-clipart.png)

Easily stained however<br>![birdshit](https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/147-1472116_royalty-free-collection-of-high-quality-free-cliparts.png)

But shit makes inventful<br>![feather pen](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQF8SI83PV8vXV1DoUtGe4-wt_IT3Bq7BGJ6RVZlUnh64Azp9eGOwRd7vzZUaIzrqte6Ik&usqp=CAU)

For lousy scriblers a mechanical contraption was developed<br>![typewriter](https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/23/67/drawing-of-old-typewriter-with-a-paper-in-black-vector-20272367.jpg)

Against sneezing and bird droppings many people covered their paper document with a glass plate and put a lamp behind it<br>![monitor](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/old-retro-crt-monitor-display-blank-white-screen-isolated-background-162226372.jpg)

Electronics moved most of the typewriter behind the paper, leaving only a thin keyboard in front of it, attached by some wire<br>![keyboard](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FOT/CW6G/HPFZZGBK/FOTCW6GHPFZZGBK.jpg?auto=webp)

Nowadays invisible wires connect to some cloud that allows typing on papers elsewhere<br>![cloud](https://images.theconversation.com/files/243663/original/file-20181102-83644-b06itk.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop)

# BUT NOW DATA-ASSISTED, INTERACTIVE, MULTI-USER, RIGHT?

Well, usually ...<br>![dead papers](deadpapers.jfif)

Because ...<br>
![CopyPasteWaste](CopyPasteWaste.png)<br>


- styled text becoming plain text<br>[IMG]
- WordArt becoming an raster image, in which you can't search<br>[IMG]
- infinite zoomable vector graphics turned into a raster image in which zooming quickly becomes pixelated.<br>[IMG]
- video becoming a silent snapshot<br>[IMG]
- interactive objects becoming dead photos<br>[IMG]

But there's more than just end results, there's also context and process:
- If in manually copy-pasting a mistake is made, making a slight or completely wrong selection, that mistake is often impossible to detect in the result, let alone repairable.
- As you copy only a result, you miss the process behind it; a disaster for REPRODUCIBILITY and reasoning about and experimenting with the matter.
- It's awfully difficult to keep files consistent with each other (within specified versions)
- A later change in the source will not be automatically reflected in where it's copied to. There it will be out of date.

# LINK REFER, AND EMBED INSTEAD !
We all know hyperlinks to manually click from one page to the next, but web addresses (or URLs) can do more. Algorithms (these things computer programmers create) use URLs to refer to up-to-date input data. And now there's a way to just use algorithms and their output within your **TEXT** in so-called Electronic Lab Notebooks. So where shared documents like Google Docs and Word within Teams are famous for cooperating among writers, these notebooks allow to add programmers, **CODE** (in which anybody can read where data comes from) and results (often **PLOT**).
![Text, Code, Result](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789800265/graphics/assets/318443e2-2a55-4b0e-b59a-b89118d0b7ff.png)
## *Especially NON-techies :heart: this, because without being forced to code themselves, they have short feedback cycles with their techy colleagues (or support staff) and after a while often start some coding themselves too.*
And as notebooks are usually built on web technology, you can then include almost anything found on the web.


# JUST TRY IT TOGETHER !
For **open science** reasons, my order of preference is: Jupyter, R&nbsp;notebooks, Observable
![notebook brands](notebooks.png)

_psst: Notebooks can be exported to several formats, both dynamic (dashboards, web apps, etc.) and static (e.g. stone tablets now named PDF)._

- Sicco de Knecht, Open Science at @UniUtrecht and @MinOCW  (and ex-scienceguide) liked the above
- If you like this, you probably like [FAIR files listing](https://github.com/steltenpower/FAIRfilesListing) too. Have a coder available for a bit, to implement?
- A bit more difficult to wrap your head around, but the more powerful: [Train of Thought](https://github.com/steltenpower/Train-Of-Thought/blob/main/README.md). Slowly moving forward, possibly a lot faster soon.
