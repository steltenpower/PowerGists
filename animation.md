# ROCK, PAPER, ~~SCISSORS~~ SCIENCE NOTEBOOKS

How the very first rock hard science documents were made ...<br>![tablets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/technology-backup-backed_up-spare-history-caves-shr1435_low.jpg)

... and delivered to readers.<br>![trebucheting](https://www.toonpool.com/user/3107/files/send_email_380405.jpg)

Luckily lighter materials were soon found ...<br>![paper airplane](https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/31-317183_painted-paper-plane-hand-png-download-free-clipart.png)

... easily stained however.<br>![birdshit](https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/147-1472116_royalty-free-collection-of-high-quality-free-cliparts.png)

Shit makes inventful though ...<br>![feather pen](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQF8SI83PV8vXV1DoUtGe4-wt_IT3Bq7BGJ6RVZlUnh64Azp9eGOwRd7vzZUaIzrqte6Ik&usqp=CAU)

... with contraptions for lousy scriblers ...<br>![typewriter](https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/23/67/drawing-of-old-typewriter-with-a-paper-in-black-vector-20272367.jpg)

... later shielding against bird droppings ...<br>![monitor](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/old-retro-crt-monitor-display-blank-white-screen-isolated-background-162226372.jpg)

Then digitalization brought limitless possibilities ...<br>![cloud](https://images.theconversation.com/files/243663/original/file-20181102-83644-b06itk.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop)

... but physical paper (simulation) habits stayed ...<br>![cutPaste](https://diy.bostik.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_crop/public/2020-10/Bostik-DIY-SouthAfrica-Stationery-Cut%27nPaste-40g%2Bscissors-product-teaser-600x600.jpg?itok=fLdeEB0t)

... not using the hyper-connected interactivity of the web<br>![dead papers](deadpapers.jfif)

Part of the problem is ``*``content type incompatibilities between applications:<br>![CopyPasteWaste](CopyPasteWaste.png)

- styled text becoming plain text<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- Formulas becoming raster images, in which you can't search<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- infinite zoomable vector graphics turned into a pixelated raster images<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- video becoming a silent snapshot<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- interactive objects becoming dead photos<br>[animatedIMG needed?]<br><br>

Probably more important, but not as easy to notice: the context and process is lost, a **disaster for REPRODUCIBILITY**:
- Reasoning about and experimenting with the matter, is frustrated<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- It's awfully difficult to keep files consistent with each other (within specified versions). Google "git" when finished reading this page<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- A later change in the source will not be automatically reflected in where it's copied to. There it will be out of date<br>[animatedIMG needed?]
- When you didn't copy (or type) what you thought you did, it is often impossible to detect, let alone repair<br>[animatedIMG needed?]

# EMBED YOUR DATA SCIENCE IN A WEB-POWERED NOTEBOOK INSTEAD!
We all know hyperlinks to manually click from one page to the next, but web addresses (or URLs) can do much more. Algorithms (these things computer programmers create) for example use URLs to refer to up-to-date input data. And now there's a way to edit and run algorithms (or "**CODE**"), plus show their output (often **PLOTS**)  within your **TEXT** in so-called Electronic Lab Notebooks. So where shared documents like Google Docs and Word/Teams are famous for cooperating among writers, these notebooks allow to add programmers.
![Text, Code, Result](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789800265/graphics/assets/318443e2-2a55-4b0e-b59a-b89118d0b7ff.png)
## *Especially NON-techies :heart: this, because without being forced to code themselves, they have short feedback cycles with their techy colleagues (or support staff) and after a while often start some coding themselves too.*
As these notebooks are built on web technology, you can include/embed almost anything found on the web. The helpful communities around them have also created all sorts of things to extend them, so many of your "wouldn't it be nice if ..."-wishes are already implemented and available.

**JUST TRY IT WITH YOUR TEAM**: For **open science** reasons, my order of preference is:
![notebook brands](notebooks.png)

_psst: Notebooks can be exported to several formats, both dynamic (dashboards, web apps, etc.) and static (e.g. stone tablets now named PDF)._

``*`` content type incompatibilities occur less when sticking to open file formats, which help Interoperability, the I in FAIR data. To make that easier
[FAIR files listing](https://github.com/steltenpower/FAIRfilesListing) was thought up. Hoping to implement it everywhere.
