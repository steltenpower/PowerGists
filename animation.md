## CUT THE HABIT OF COPY:scissors:PASTE
![CopyPasteWaste](CopyPasteWaste.png)

## EMBED YOUR (DATA) SCIENCE IN WEB-POWERED NOTEBOOKS!
We all know hyperlinks to manually click from one page to the next, but web addresses (or URLs) can do much more. Algorithms created by computer programmers for example use URLs to refer to up-to-date input data³. And now there's a way to edit and run these algorithms (aka **Code**), plus show their output (often **Plot**) within your **Text** in so-called Electronic Lab Notebooks.
![Text, Code, Result](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789800265/graphics/assets/318443e2-2a55-4b0e-b59a-b89118d0b7ff.png)
So where shared documents like Google Docs and Word/Teams are famous for cooperating among writers, these notebooks enable adding programmers.

## WHY ESPECIALLY NON-TECHIES :heart: THIS
Without being forced to code yourself, you can have shorter feedback cycles with your techy colleagues (or support staff). After a while however, many do make their first code edits.

As these notebooks are built on web technology, you can include/embed almost anything found on the web⁴. The helpful communities around them have also created all sorts of things to extend them, so many of your "wouldn't it be nice if …"-wishes are already implemented and available. Plus you can still use any application outside the notebook, while using the flow of the notebook to coordinate, for example: call an outside script to add a manual overlay, or get notified that after the last input change no new file was saved yet for the output of a manual step.

## GO TRY IT WITH YOUR TEAM
As your team probably shares files behind a login, it's good to know you can have notebooks within that same environment too, which will also speed things up and depending the server make heavy computation on big data possible.
R and Python are the most popular programming languages in data science nowadays, and <a href="https://carpentries.org">carpentries.org</a> lessons can give you a useful start in a day or two. There are many different notebooks and derivatives, but here are 3 popular ones and the languages they support:
<table><tr><td>

  <img src="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20210721005245/en/892813/2/Observable_Logo.jpg"></td><td>JavaScript
  </td></tr></table>

Now go talk to your research supporter about it!
If (s)he tells you to provide PDFs instead, explain it can export to formats like dashboards, web apps, presentation 'sheets', and static formats including that stone tablet format.

ENJOY!

## NOTES
¹: Part of that problem is fixed by using open file formats (e.g. HTML, SVG, ePub, Open Document Format, frictionless data, Linked Data), where implementations in popular open source software usually shine. To help the end user with both, [FAIR files listing](https://github.com/steltenpower/FAIRfilesListing) was thought up. Looking to have it implemented everywhere for you, so help out!

²: make sure to look into the de facto standard for version control (of collections of files to be edited by groups): [git](https://thenewstack.io/tutorial-git-for-absolutely-everyone/)

³: Working more data-driven will get errors and inefficient information structures noticed more often and earlier. Personal responsibility, in-context feedback options throughout the organisation and automatic data quality checks in several places are a necessity for grown-up efficient information management. Start with spell checkers everywhere and keep growing.

⁴	: If your institution really wants open science, it also provides everybody with both a public and an internal way of (web)serving the most succesfull open format (HTML), right? RIGHT?

## THE END
(Thanks to everybody honestly pointing me at nerd speak to get rid off in the draft versions or motivating me to keep going to make it just right.)

## TODO
- Fix images, certainly those in "LOSING INFORMATION" and "LOSING PROCESS". Also buy stock photos, improve own photos
- Create a 1080p YouTube clip with the above visual reasoning as introduction, followed by some actual (not too technically overwhelming, showing sliders for sure) notebook-based cooperation (have footage? want to create?)
- Turn this itself in [a notebook to present as sheets](https://medium.com/@mjspeck/presenting-code-using-jupyter-notebook-slides-a8a3c3b59d67)
- Improve layout in the sheets
