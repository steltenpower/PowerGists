# PAPER HISTORY

How it all started ...<br>![tablets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/technology-backup-backed_up-spare-history-caves-shr1435_low.jpg)

Be where the readers are, one thought<br>![trebucheting](https://www.toonpool.com/user/3107/files/send_email_380405.jpg)

Luckily lighter materials were found<br>![paper airplane](https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/31-317183_painted-paper-plane-hand-png-download-free-clipart.png)

Easily stained however<br>![birdshit](https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/147-1472116_royalty-free-collection-of-high-quality-free-cliparts.png)

But shit makes inventful<br>![feather pen](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQF8SI83PV8vXV1DoUtGe4-wt_IT3Bq7BGJ6RVZlUnh64Azp9eGOwRd7vzZUaIzrqte6Ik&usqp=CAU)

For lousy scriblers a mechanical contraption was developed<br>![typewriter](https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/23/67/drawing-of-old-typewriter-with-a-paper-in-black-vector-20272367.jpg)

Against sneezing and bird droppings many people covered their paper document with a glass plate and put a lamp behind it<br>![monitor](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/old-retro-crt-monitor-display-blank-white-screen-isolated-background-162226372.jpg)

Electronics moved most of the typewriter behind the paper, leaving only a thin keyboard in front of it, attached by some wire<br>![keyboard](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FOT/CW6G/HPFZZGBK/FOTCW6GHPFZZGBK.jpg?auto=webp)

Nowadays invisible wires connect to some cloud that allows typing on papers elsewhere<br>![cloud](https://images.theconversation.com/files/243663/original/file-20181102-83644-b06itk.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop)

# PAPER STILL

What 4-letter word, that our narratives nowadays are often heavily based on, was not mentioned so far ?

hints: ????-driven, or better: ????-assisted

DATA !!!!

But, aren't many documents still much like a sheet of paper in some sort of typewriter?

# NO COPY-PASTE WASTE !

Those who do use data, often copy-paste it into a document, but:
![CopyPasteWaste](CopyPasteWaste.png)
- If in manual copy-pasting a mistake is made, that often is impossible to detect in the result, let alone possible to repair.
- The process that created something, is not part of what's pasted; a disaster for REPRODUCIBILITY and reasoning about and experimenting with the matter.
- It's much more difficult to manage files consistent with each other within specified versions
- There's no (later) synchronization between input and output of a copy-paste action

# EMBED INSTEAD !
Enrich your text with algorithms (also known as **CODE**) that can process **LIVE DATA** and show results, often plots.
So-called Electronic Lab notebooks can do this.
![Text, Code, Result](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789800265/graphics/assets/318443e2-2a55-4b0e-b59a-b89118d0b7ff.png)
## *Especially NON-techies :heart: this, because without being forced to code themselves, they can have their techy colleagues (or support staff) in the same shared document doing their magic (including embedding almost anything already on the web!!)*


# JOIN TOO !
For **open science** reasons, my order of preference is: Jupyter, R&nbsp;notebooks, Observable
![notebook brands](notebooks.png)

_psst: Notebooks can be exported to several formats, both dynamic (dashboards, web apps, etc.) and static (e.g. stone tablets now named PDF)._

- Sicco de Knecht liked the above
- If you like this, you probably like [FAIR files listing](https://github.com/steltenpower/FAIRfilesListing) too. Have a coder available for a bit, to implement?
- A bit more difficult to wrap your head around, but the more powerful: [Train of Thought](https://github.com/steltenpower/Train-Of-Thought/blob/main/README.md). Slowly moving forward, possibly a lot faster soon.
