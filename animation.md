- Losing style<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png) Copy selected text preferably shaped for extra meaning (and showing cursor) within visual, Paste plain text
- Losing direct edit, search, index.<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png) Copy visual including text, Paste raster image (with pointer over text, not cursor)
- Losing sharpness<br>![vector2raster](https://logosbynick.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/vector-raster.png) Copy vector image, Paste pixelated raster image
- Losing interactivity, animation and sound<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png) Copy [animated Fourier](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Fourier_series_square_wave_circles_animation.svg) Paste static raster image

<br><br>

… and losing context and process, thereby **KILLING REPRODUCIBILITY**.
- Unrepairable manual errors<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png) Not copying what was meant to be copied, e.g. missing one character or digit, or adding a space.
- No experimenting.<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png) Copy a slider and the parameter it controls. Paste a static number.
- No auto-updating.<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png) If the original data changed, it wouldn't change here (not automatically and not on page refresh)
- File edits less consistently manageable².<br>![animation needed](https://www.theromegroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image-needed-300x200.png) change table from one app, forget to update chart from other app. Inconsistency introduced.

# EMBED YOUR DATA SCIENCE IN A WEB-POWERED NOTEBOOK INSTEAD!
We all know hyperlinks to manually click from one page to the next, but web addresses (or URLs) can do much more. Algorithms created by computer programmers for example use URLs to refer to up-to-date input data³. And now there's a way to edit and run these algorithms (aka **Code**), plus show their output (often **Plot**) within your **Text** in so-called Electronic Lab Notebooks. So where shared documents like Google Docs and Word/Teams are famous for cooperating among writers, these notebooks enable adding programmers.
![Text, Code, Result](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781789800265/graphics/assets/318443e2-2a55-4b0e-b59a-b89118d0b7ff.png)🛈[image](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781789800265/1/ch01lvl1sec07/launching-a-jupyter-notebook), CC, [license](https://github.com/temporaer/tutorial_ml_gkbionics/blob/master/LICENSE)🛈
## *Especially NON-techies :heart: this, because without being forced to code themselves, they have short feedback cycles with their techy colleagues (or support staff) and after a while often start some coding themselves too.*
As these notebooks are built on web technology, you can include/embed almost anything found on the web⁴. The helpful communities around them have also created all sorts of things to extend them, so many of your "wouldn't it be nice if …"-wishes are already implemented and available. Plus you can still use any application outside the notebook, while using the flow of the notebook to coordinate, for example: call an outside script to add a manual overlay, or get notified that after the last input change no new file was saved yet for the output of a manual step.

**JUST TRY IT WITH YOUR TEAM**: For **open science** reasons, my order of preference is:

Your work can then also be exported to both dynamic (dashboards, web apps, etc.) and static formats (e.g. stone tablets now named PDF).

ENJOY!

¹: Part of that problem is fixed by using open file formats (e.g. HTML, SVG, ePub, Open Document Format, Linked Data, frictionless data), where implementations in popular open source software usually shine. To help the end user with both, [FAIR files listing](https://github.com/steltenpower/FAIRfilesListing) was thought up. Looking to have it implemented everywhere for you, so help out!

²: make sure to look into the de facto standard for version control (of collections of files to be edited by groups): [git](https://thenewstack.io/tutorial-git-for-absolutely-everyone/)

³: Working more data-driven will get errors noticed more often. Have responsibility and automatic checks on many levels for a grown-up information management. Start with spell checkers everywhere.

⁴	: If your institution really wants open science, it also provides everybody with both a public and an internal way of (web)serving the most succesfull open format (HTML), right? RIGHT?

What this fundamentally means for the quality and range of science: ["The scientific paper is obsolete"](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/), The Atlantic, APRIL 5, 2018

A more technically detailed article in Nature: ["Cut the tyranny of copy-and-paste with these coding tools"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00563-z), 28 February 2022

THE END (Thanks to everybody honestly pointing me at nerd speak to get rid off in the draft versions or motivating me to keep going to make it just right.)

TODO:
- Replace the "image needed" images with actual images and then delete the text describing what image is needed
- Add blood to feather image
- Buy stock photos, improve own photos
- Turn this into proper HTML document with layout, where [the 8 images explaining the problem of Cut/Copy/Paste](#the-old-habits-troubles-are-non-i%CC%B2n%CC%B2t%CC%B2e%CC%B2r%CC%B2o%CC%B2p%CC%B2e%CC%B2r%CC%B2a%CC%B2b%CC%B2l%CC%B2e%CC%B2content-types-) will be arranged into 2 sets of each a 2x2 grid of images.
- Create a 1080p YouTube clip with the above visual reasoning as introduction, followed by some actual (not too technically overwhelming) notebook-based cooperation (have footage? want to create?)
